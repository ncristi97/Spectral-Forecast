An implementation after Paul A. Gagniuc et al. Spectral Forecast: A general purpose prediction model as an alternative to classical neural networks.  Chaos 30, 033119 (2020); doi: 10.1063/1.5120818

The model revolves around three known states: two extreme outcomes (A and B) and one measurement (P). These states are
represented by matrices that include sets of homologous parameters. An information spectrum is described as a series of predicted
states (M1, M2, M3,..., Md) generated between the two extreme
outcomes (A and B). The predicted states are compared with the
known state (P) from the measurements to generate a similarity
index.
